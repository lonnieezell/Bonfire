That's Bonfire's goal: provide a solid base off of which to build your new web applications. It's not a CMS. Instead, it's a springboard to build off of with many of the tools you wish you had on projects but never took the time to build.

All wrapped up in an elegant interface that will make you proud when you hand the project over to your client.

## Current Features

- Very flexible template/theme system, capable of Wordpress-like parent/child themes.
- Uses Twitter Bootstrap for the Admin and Default themes
- Fully modular and built around HMVC
- 4 ‘contexts’ ready for your code: Content, Reports, Settings and Developer Tools
- Database backup and maintenance interface
- Role-based access control
- Built-in users/auth system
- Code Builder with CRUD generation
- Simple email queue system
- 2-step installer
- Uses multiple-environment config files.
- Migration-ready (using either raw SQL or Database Forge commands)
- Log view/maintenance
