# Faster Development of CodeIgniter 2.0 Apps

That's Bonfire's goal: provide a solid base off of which to build your new web applications. It's not a CMS (though it will ship with some pretty powerful page and parsing capabilities). Instead, it's a springboard to build off of with many of the tools you wish you had on projects but never took the time to build.

All wrapped up in an elegant interface that will make you proud when you hand the project over to your client.

## Planned Features

The following features are planned for inclusion into Bonfire:

- User Management with customizable profile fields
- Role-Based Access Control
- Database Management, Backup and Restore
- Migrations Built-In
- File Manager
- Deployment Helpers
- Task-based interface (Content, Statistics, Appearance, Settings, and Developer Tools)
- Support for development, staging/testing, and production environments out of the box
- Powerful parent/child-based theme system
- Flexible Assets system to make keeping front-end performance high simple.
- Page management with a slick front-end editor
- Customizable tags for Page parsing
- SEO Tools
- Email Queue processing
- Cron-task processor
- Easily validate your HTML from within the UI
- Completely modular/HMVC development that makes it simple to add custom features
- Site-, Front-, and Admin Controllers
- Powerful, yet easy to use Base Model to reduce coding time
- Full Documentation

and possibly even more...

## Lend A Hand

If you're interested in helping out, fork the project and start coding! I'd love to have you on board. You can always shoot me an email at lonnieje@gmail.com and we can talk about how you'll best fit it and what the best place to start coding would be.

*NOTE: Latest database dump can be found under bonfire/db/backups. Import that into a new database, and setup your database connections and you should be good to go. You can login to the admin /admin with email: admin@bonfire.com, pass: bonfire.*

Let's make this the best kick-start to any CodeIgniter project.
