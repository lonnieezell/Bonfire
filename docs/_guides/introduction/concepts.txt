Title: Important Concepts

There are certain concepts that, while not necessarily unique to Bonfire, will be important for you to understand to get the most out of Bonfire. 


About: Contexts

A *Context* is an area of similar responsibility, like _Settings_, _Reports_ or _Developer Tools_. The Contexts form the main navigation through Bonfire's admin area. There are three contexts that are required (as well as a Public Context), and you can create as many additional Contexts as you desire. 

	Reports		- Should provide reporting functions related to your application.
	Settings	- Any settings related to your module. These are typically items to are infrequently changed, like the number of events to show on per page, etc.
	Developer	- This context is meant for tools designed to make the application developer's life easier and may include database tools, code generation, deploy helpers, etc.
	Public		- This is a general category for any controllers that will directly show information to the public.
	
With the exception of the Public context, creating a controller for your module for a specific controller is a simple as naming your controller to match the context. A controller for the _content_ context, would be named *content.php*, while one that shows up in the _settings_ context would be named *setting.php*. For the public context, the controller should be named the same as the module. For example, a  _Pages_ module would have a public controller called *pages.php*.

Each module will automatically show up in the appropriate area of the Admin UI. Again, with the exception of public contexts, which are only available to the public-facing site.



About: Modules

Modules are collections of MVC triads that contain functionality limited to one specific area, like Pages or Database Tools. They are the heart of Bonfire and you will spend most of your time developing new modules. Modules can contain their Models, Controllers, Views, Helpers, Libraries, config files, language files and even styles and scripts.

Modules are covered in more detail in <Creating Modules> topic.


About: HMVC

Heirarchical Models Views and Controllers, or HMVC, provides a powerful new way to work build your web pages. It keeps functionality packaged into discreet modules and provides a simple way to include them in your views. 

In a typical CodeIgniter workflow, your Controller would be responsible for pulling the data from various models and libraries and adding them to a $data array that is sent to the view. This means that the view becomes larger and more difficult to maintain, as the amount of information on your page grows. Using HMVC, you can delegate the display of that information to the module it belongs to. 

Imagine that you're building a web site for a newspaper. The front page would have a number of different types of content, including stories and advertising. You would create a Stories module that contains all of your admin power, but then would also create your public context (simply a controller called _stories_) that contains methods to display the featured story and recent stories. 

In your site's index file, you would use the *modules::run* method to display the results of the story methods.

> <?php echo modules::run('stories/stories/render_featured' 1) ?>

In this example, the stories module, stories controller, render_featured() method is being called. Within that method, it pulls the data from the database, and then renders a view. This view is cached by PHP and returned to the modules::run() method. The end result is that your main index file is clean, while the contents of the stories render_feature() method is inserted at the proper location in the index file.

You would also create an Advertising module that has a public controller responsible for displaying the different blocks of advertising. You might call it using the _render_ad_block()_ method in your site's index page.

> <?php echo modules::run('advertising/advertising/render_ad_block', 'block_type') ?>

HMVC allows for a very clean way of working and keeping your information separated and easily maintainable.
