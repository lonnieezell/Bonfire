Title: Installing Bonfire

Bonfire has a simple installation script that is designed to help you, the developer, get up and running with a minimum of fuss. It is not currently designed to be used for an end product that you distribute. 

About: Requirements

If you can run CodeIgniter Reactor 2.0 on your server, then you should be able to run Bonfire without a hitch.

- <PHP at http://php.net> version 5.1.6 or newer.
- <MySQL at http://www.mysql.com> 4+ database. Currently, other databases are not supported.

About: Installing

To start the installation process, simply head to http://yoursite.com/install.

You should be greeted by a Welcome screen that asks you for: 

	Your Database information	- Enter the connection details for your database. Click Test DB.
	
	If all goes well, it should direct you to Step 2 (the final step), where you just need to enter your: 

	Site Title	- The name of your site, as it will appear in the browser's title bar or tab.
	Username	- Choose a username to log into the site with (if the site is setup that way).
	Password	- Type a password and confirm it.
	Your Email	- This will be the address that you use to log in with, as well as the address
				  used to send system emails from. This can be changed later to be able to use
				  separate addresses for login and system emails. 
				  
By default, Bonfire is setup to use emails to login with, and not use usernames at all. This can be easily configured on the main settings screen.

Assuming that everything proceeds without a hitch, you will be redirected to the login screen. Enter the email and password you just used, and you will be sent to the admin dashboard where you can start building your app.
