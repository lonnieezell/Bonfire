Title: Modules Overview

About: What Are Modules?

At it's heart, Bonfire is nothing more than a pretty interface that can communicate with modules in a pre-determined way. Almost all of your web application will be creating new modules.

Modules are groups of code that work together for a common purpose, containing models, views, controllers, libraries, and most any other type of file that CodeIgniter understands. Modules are possible through the use of <WireDesignz' at http://codeigniter.com/forums/member/45875/> <Modular Extensions HMVC at https://bitbucket.org/wiredesignz/codeigniter-modular-extensions-hmvc/wiki/Home>, and support the full HMVC pattern. These files should all focus on a single topic, like an event calendar, pages, a blog system, newsletter, etc.


About: Contexts

In Bonfire, there are 6 distinct contexts that help to separate the logic of your modules' controllers into tight compartments. The Contexts are... 

	Content		- Any functions relating to creating or changing something that would be considered 'site content'. This might include pages, snippets of code, events, newsletters, galleries and more.
	Statistics	- Should provide reporting functions related to your application.
	Appearance	- Anything to do with how the module appears within the public-facing site. This is usually for customizing the CSS of the module, or similar functions. If all your module needs is a few settings, these should go in...
	Settings	- Any settings related to your module. These are typically items to are infrequently changed, like the number of events to show on per page, etc.
	Developer	- This context is meant for tools designed to make the application developer's life easier and may include database tools, code generation, deploy helpers, etc.
	Public		- This is a general category for any controllers that will directly show information to the public.
	
With the exception of the Public context, creating a controller for your module for a specific controller is a simple as naming your controller to match the context. A controller for the _content_ context, would be named *content.php*, while one that shows up in the _settings_ context would be named *setting.php*. For the public context, the controller should be named the same as the module. For example, a  _Pages_ module would have a public controller called *pages.php*.

Each module will automatically show up in the appropriate area of the Admin UI. Again, with the exception of public contexts, which are only available to the public-facing site.
