Title: Upgrading

To upgrade Bonfire, you simply overwrite the files/folders of the latest version directly over your old files. It is highly recommended that you backup your existing files/folders before, as an added precaution.

The following files are specifically recommended to backup...

- bonfire/application/config/application.php
- bonfire/application/config/config.php
- bonfire/application/config/database.php
- bonfire/application/config/email.php
- bonfire/application/config/development/*.php
- bonfire/application/config/testing/*.php
- bonfire/application/config/production/*.php
- bonfire/application/core/MY_Controller.php

Additionally, if you have made custom themes, modules, or other files, you should back these up.
