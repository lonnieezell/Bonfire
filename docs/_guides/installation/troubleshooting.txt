Title: Troubleshooting Guide

If you run into problems installing Bonfire, the following troubleshooting tips may help you. More tips will be added as they are found.



About: Only the Welcome to Bonfire page will display

It might be that your server environment does not support the PATH_INFO variable needed to serve search-engine friendly pages. As a first step, open your *bonfire/application/config/config.php* and look for the _URI Protocol_ setting. By default, this is set to AUTO and works in most cases. Try changing this variable to one each of the other settings, one at a time, and see if one of these works for your environment. 

> $config['uri_protocol']	= 'AUTO';


About: Every page throws a Page Not Found error.

The most common cause of this is not having mod_rewrite (or equivalent) installed, or you have a missing .htaccess file. 

If you know your server does not have mod_rewrite installed, then you will need to edit the _bonfire/application/config/config.php_ file. Find the Index File section and add _index.php_ to it. 

> $config['index_page'] = 'index.php';

If this works, but all of your URL's now redirect you to the welcome screen, you might need to add a question mark to the end of it. 

> $config['index_page'] = 'index.php?';
