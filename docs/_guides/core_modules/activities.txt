Title: Activities

The Activities module provides a simple way to log user's activities as they use the system. 

Many web applications will track when a user logs in, or changes their profile settings, or sends an email, etc. They will then show that information in various places throughout the UI. A very complex example of this might be Facebook's Wall, which is simply a stream of recent activity that allows users to comment on the activities. 

That's what the Activities module helps you integrate into your application. 



About: Loading the Module

The activities module primarily consists of a single model that allows you to get and save user activity. It is loaded like any other model in CodeIgniter.

> $this->load->model('activities/activity_model');

Once loaded, the Activity object is available through: *$this->activity_model*.



About: Logging User Activity

You record new user activity through the *log_activity()* method.

> $this->activity_model->log_activity($user_id, $activity, $module);

The method takes three parametersâ€¦

*$user_id* is and INT that matches the user_id of the user that performed the activity.

*$activity* is a string that will tells what activity the user did. This string should be written so that it would fit in a sentence immediately following their username. For example, if you wanted to record a login, the activity might be 'logged in via IP 127.0.0.0'. 

*$module* is a string that matches the name of the module recording the activity. This allows any module to pull only the activities related to that module.



About: Displaying User Activity

To display user activities in the most flexible way, you would use the *find_by_module()* method to retrieve an array of all activity for a single module.

> $activities = $this->activity_model->find_by_module($module);

Where *$module* is a string representing the name of the module to retrieve activity for.

Once you have the data you can either loop through the data in your view, or create a new view that renders the items for you.

><?php if (isset($activities) && is_array($activities) && count($activities)) : ?>
><ul>
>	<?php foreach ($activities as $activity) :?>
>		<?php 
>			$identity = config_item('auth.login_type') == 'email' ? $activity->email : $activity->username;
>		?>
>		
>		<li>
>			<span class="small"><?php echo relative_time(strtotime($activity->created_on)) ?></span>
>			<br/>
>			<b><?php echo $identity ?></b> <?php echo $activity->activity ?>
>		</li>
>	<?php endforeach; ?>
></ul>
><?php endif; ?>
