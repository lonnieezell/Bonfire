Title: Roles

The Roles Module provides a simple, yet flexible Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for your applications. It works hand-in-hand with the <Permissions> Module to restrict access to any part of your application.



About: Roles Overview

Roles allow you to segregate which groups of users can access which parts of your site, or what actions they can perform once they are there. By default, Bonfire ships with several pre-made roles. You can keep these in place, or modify to suit your needs. 

- *Administrator* accounts have full control over every aspect of the site. 
- *Developer* accounts typically are the only ones that can access the developer tools. Otherwise identical to Administrators, at least until the site is handed off.
- *Editor* accounts can handle day-to-day management, but do not have full power of an Administrator.
- *User* accounts are the default account types that have the ability to login to the site.
- *Banned* accounts are not allowed to login to the site at all.


About: Creating New Roles

New Roles can be created by navigating to Settings / Roles and clicking the 'Create new role' button. Each role has the following settings...

- *Role Name* is the name of the role. This name is used for both display throughout the site and for certain <Auth> functions.
- *Description* is an optional piece of text that describes the role's abilities.
- *Login Destination* is the path that a user is rerouted to upon successful login. This allows you to have Administrators automatically log into the Bonfire Admin UI, while Users reach their own backend that's custom to your application. 
- *Default Role* If checked, this is the role that any new subscribers to your site are given. By default, this is the _User_ role.
- *Removable* determines whether the role can be deleted. When managing roles, any user that belongs to a Role with Bonfire.Roles.Delete permission, will see the option at the bottom of the Edit Profile screen to delete it.
- The *Permissions* section provides several matrixes based on the Permissions in the system that allow you to define exactly what that Role is allowed to do. If a permission is checked, they can access those portions of the site, otherwise they are not allowed.
