Title: UI

The UI module holds small helper functions for creating common interface elements. The module is a small one, currently, but expected to grow as Bonfire does.



About: Loading the UI module

The UI module is simply a helper file that provides additional functions. It can be loaded like any standard library.

> $this->load->helper('ui/ui_helper');



About: Search Box

> render_search_box()

This function creates a Search block for the left-hand column list in a Master-Detail view. It is designed to sit in a _panel-header_ and provides a simple link that, when clicked, will show a search box. It uses the _ui.js_ to automatically filter the results in the list based on the <p> tag in each list item.
