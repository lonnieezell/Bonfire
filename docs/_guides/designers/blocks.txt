Title: Blocks

Blocks can be thought of as small areas of a page that have been set aside for content, but that aren't required to actually put content there. Kinda of like a parking spot for HTML.



About: Reserving Block Space

In your layout file, you would reserve, say a sidebar, room by calling...

> <?php Template::block('sidebar', 'partials/sidebar'); ?>

The first parameter is just a name for the block, that you can reference it by later.

The second parameter is the default view that is used, if nothing else has been specified. This can be left blank.

An (optional) third parameter allows you to pass an array of key/value pairs to the view.

Another (optional) fourth parameter can be set to true to tell Bonfire to look for this view inside of the theme, not in the standard view file locations.



About: Setting Block Content

At this point, your sidebar has his spot reserved, and default content that will show up on all of the pages. What happens on the Contact Us page when you need a different sidebar? No problemo. Observe (from within your controller)...

> Template::set_block('sidebar', 'sidebar');

The first parameter is the name of the block to put the content into. 

The second parameter is the view to render. The _set_block()_ method follows the normal cascading rules and will search for the view file in the following order...

- themes/_active_theme_/block.php
- themes/_default_theme_/block.php
- _current_module_/views/block.php
- application/views/block.php
