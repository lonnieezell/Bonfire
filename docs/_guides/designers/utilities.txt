Title: Template Utility Functions

The template class also provides a handful of small convenience methods that help out with little page display-related issues.



About: check_class()

The _check_class()_ function is meant to be used within your primary navigation, and performs a very simple check to see if the first parameter matches the name of the controller that is currently running. If it does, it spits out _class="current"_.

In your views...

>	<ul id="nav-main">
> 		<li><a href="#" <?php echo current_class('welcome') ?> >Home</a></li>
> 		<li><a href="#" <?php echo current_class('about') ?> >About</a></li>
> 	</ul>



About: check_method()

The _check_method()_ function is identical to the _check_class()_ function, above, except that it is meant for sub-navigation based on the method currently being executed (according to the router).



About: breadcrumb()

When you need to display some basic breadcrumbs in your layouts, you've got a quick little function to help you out...

> <?php echo breadcrumb(); ?>

This creates a basic breadcrumb that is a series of links separated by a symbol of your choosing, that would look something like...

> Home : Pages : This Page

The breadcrumb is built from the URI segments of the current page. If the default uri 
segments will not work for a page in your application, you can pass an array of key/value 
pairs that represent the crumbs. The key of each pair is the value that will be shown, while 
the value of each pair represents the url segment to pass into it.

You can change the symbol used to separate the links in your breadcrumb in the _config/application.php_ file.

> $config['template.breadcrumb_symbol']	= ' : ';
