Title: Flash Messages

CodeIgniter's Flash messages (through the session class) have one major drawback: they only work if the page has been refreshed, either through a redirect or user interaction. Sometimes, though, we need instant feedback, and we don't need to hit the server with more HTTP requests. That's why Bonfire provides it's own 'flash messages'.

While only a single message is supported at a time, that is typically all that is needed, as these messages are meant for simple status updates (like, "Yo! The hard drive crashed while saving your resume!").

Setting a message is fairly straight-forward. In your controller...

> Template::set_message('This is your message.', 'success');

The first parameter is the actual message itself. The second parameter is simply a CSS class-name that will be attached to the markup 
specified in the conﬁg file.

Now, in your view file, wherever you want this message to show up, just use...

> <?php echo Template::message(); ?>

Just in case I wasn't clear earlier, Bonfire's messages work both with a page refresh AND without. When the page is refreshed (and the session library is loaded), Bonfire actually uses the session lib's own flashdata with a name of 'message' to store it across the 
refresh.
