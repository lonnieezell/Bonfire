# Change Log

## Under development

### 0.7.1 - not released

Additional Changes:

* Replaced Assets::$asset_base, Assets::$asset_cache_folder, and Assets::$asset_folders with a single Assets::$directories array (these were not deprecated because they were private properties). Allow a config item ('assets.directories') to set the value of the new property, but if it is not set the library will attempt to use the old config items ('assets.base_folder', 'assets.cache_folder', and 'assets.asset_folders').
* Added closures to hold the functions for CSS/JS minification, which should facilitate swapping out the libraries that perform these functions in the future.
* Deprecated Assets::set_globals(), Assets::$external_scripts, Assets::$inline_scripts, and Assets::$module_scripts. Replaced by Assets::setGlobals() and Assets::$scripts['external']/Assets::$scripts['inline']/Assets::$scripts['module']
* Partial Russian translation
* Deprecated the module_* functions in application_helper. They're in the Modules class now.
* Deprecated form_has_error() method since CI's form_error() does the same thing.
* Docs system is much more robust now, including link fixing, separating application/developer docs in the UI, a basic search system, and more.
* Separated all Bonfire code from your Application's code
* Most bonfire specific code now uses a BF_ prefix instead of the MY_ prefix your application would use..
* The module_* methods in the application_helper file have been moved to the Modules class. The application_helper methods are still there but are considered deprecated.
* Many improvements to the Brazilian Portugeuse language handling.
* Improved support for translations in the Activities, Builder, Logs, Sysinfo, and UI modules.
* Removed Settings related to the previously removed Updates module


New Features:
* Images controller can reference images from a module using the module=... parameter.
* Template class now provides a `check_segment` method in addition to check_class and check_method.
* Brand new documentation system that allows splitting your user and dev-related docs, and searching docs.
* CSRF protection can be bypassed for individual controllers by setting `csrf_ignored_controllers` setting in the site's main index file.
* Now works with [Sparks](http://getsparks.org) out of the box.
* Added languages_available and database_types to Module Builder's configurable options. languages_available tells the builder which language files to attempt to build for a new module. database_types gives the builder some information about the types supported by the database, and is used in generating the "Database Type" select on the module builder form, as well as handling several other aspects of building the module.

## Released versions

### 0.7.0

* Minimum PHP version changed to 5.3
* Updated CodeIgniter to version 2.1.4
* Updated Bootstrap to version 2.3.2
* Updated .htaccess sections taken from html5boilerplate, supporting the new Apache 2.4.
* Updated jwerty to version 0.3.1 (seems to fix issue where creating a shortcut for '&' kills keyboard input on all admin pages)

New Features:

* [New Folder Structure](site_structure)
* The password hash changes from SHA1 (salted, but not iterated) to [phpass](http://www.openwall.com/phpass/) libraries. When on PHP 5.3 or with the Suhosin patch installed, Blowfish encryption is used. If bcrypt is not available, will fallback to extended DES-based hashes, or even to phpass' provided (but slower) hash method, if necessary.
* [MY_Model](bonfire_models) now supports Observer methods that allow your model to more easily hook into the default operations without having to rewrite the code.
* MY_Model now supports protecting attributes so they can never be set or updated.
* MY_Model handles return types differently now. Instead of passing to the functions, it's a class var that each model can set. Defaults to object. Can use new scope methods 'as_array', 'as_object()' and 'as_json()' within a call to change the output type temporarily.
* Template library's parser now includes the [Lex template language](https://github.com/pyrocms/lex) when $parse_views == TRUE in the Template.php library.
* Added get_filenames_by_extension() method to the file helper.
* MY_Controller file no longer used as we have split each controller into their own class file in application/core. This allows the HMVC autoloader to find them for us, and frees up the MY_Controller file for end-user only use.
* New front-end theme that is simply the latest Bootstrap theme with a couple of small minor tweaks.
* log_activity helper function included in the application helper. This removes the need for autoloading the activity model and also allows logging of activities to be turned off.
* New constants LOGIN_URL and REGISTER_URL are used in place throughout the site to make it easy to change the login and registration URLs.
* New docs system that provides basic methods for packaging documentation with your modules and application using Markdown formatted text files.

Closes named issues:

* #598 - Fix password help message for number required
* #557 - When logging in, check the user isn't banned
* #489 - users index: form buttons only worked for English users
* #575 - Add bf_action_edit and bf_action_undo to language file
* #580 - Add Portugese language for activities module
* #583 - Set display name when entered in the self-service user registration form
* #613 - module builder: SQL error while creating field type 'enum' and 'a', 'b', 'c' as values
* #631 - redirection to install folder fails (certain browser?)
* #617 - combine js doesn't work (when enabled in config)
* #674 - user meta should fallback to current-user if no user provided
* #672 - user meta is considered "empty" if the value is "0"
* #678 - save_meta_for returns void, but it should indicate success/failure
* #683 - Create Module from existing DB Table doesn't generate correct form field IDs
* #680 - Gravatar default images don't work for non-public sites
* #664 - Translate editor: saving sysinfo_lang.php causes CodeIgniter error
* #708 - UI module causes error when admin profiler is disabled
* #720 - builder: don't insist on providing a "length" for INT fields
* #727 - users index page: Filter wont go along with pagination
* #749 - Don't silently ignore values of password_min_length less than 8 (issue #749)
* #750 - AUTO_INCREMENT portability, fixes install errors seen on Percona Server
* #751 - Fix SITE_AREA/ homepage, if you have changed SITE_AREA
* #759 - username validation is bypassed when !auth.use_usernames
* #767 - Don't allow deleting the default role, it causes problems
* #785 - email activation can fail with "The URI you submitted has disallowed characters"

Additional changes:

* $table in MY_Model changed to $table_name to avoid potential conflict with the table library.
* database backup - fix effect of yes/no dropdowns for languages other than English
* database backup: .gzip doesn't work very well; use .gz instead
* Template::redirect() - fix escaping of url [XSS?]
* Template::redirect() - should not require javascript support, unless the current request was by ajax
* Template::render() - ajax responses - remove incorrect Content-Type and caching override headers
* builder generated index_front: escape values from user-editable data [XSS]
* users auth library: fix has_permission() when called with a role parameter
* users module: deactivate() shouldn't send "user activated" email
* users module: deactivate() should not show an error when it succeeds
* users login: don't show error when auth.allow_register==FALSE
* users forgotten password: fix "Cannot find that email in our records" message
* default theme: don't show "Sign up" link if auth.allow_register==FALSE
* fix "remember me" in modal_login
* ctrl+s should not perform dangerous actions like deleting tables, because the user might have intended to invoke a harmless browser shortcut
* tentatively standardized on `isset($_POST['save'])` when testing submit buttons.  It's not too ugly, especially when you understand the pitfalls of the alternatives.
* $return_type removed from the user_model functions: find, find_all, and find_by. Use as_array() instead.
* Template::yield() changed to Template::content() due to the addition of generators in PHP 5.5.

#### Upgrade notes

Migrations should be set to auto-run in the application config file so that the new password hash is enforced before you try to login the first time after updating. The migrations force all users to create new passwords so that the newer encryption methods are used.

The "ban" button in the users page is working now, and the permission Site.Signin.Allow has been removed.  If you created a custom role which banned logins by excluding this permission, they will now be able to log in.

If you attempt to downgrade to 0.6.*, Bonfire will at best restore Site.Signin.Allow to the Administrator role. No other role will be able to log in.  This was written with developers in mind, not downgrading a production system.  (But it would be interesting to hear any feedback).

The comment recommending `IS_AJAX` as a security check has been removed.  `IS_AJAX` is not effective as a security check.  It may have happened to prevent CSRF on AJAX methods, but Bonfire now supports CodeIgniter CSRF protection (see upgrade notes for 0.6.1).  For other purposes, you may prefer to avoid the Bonfire-specific constant in favour of the standard CodeIgniter method `$this->input->is_ajax_request()`.

Because the MY_Controller file no longer ships with Bonfire, you should make a backup of your current MY_Controller file, if you have made any changes. This file will be renamed to Base_Controller.php. Any changes you made should then be redistributed over the new Controller files in application/core.

If you use the $table class var within any of your module's model files, you will need to change that reference to $table_name.

If your module calls the activity_model for logging purposes, you will need to either switch the code to the new log_activity() helper method or load the acvitity_model explicitly.

All templates that use the current Template::yield() function must be updated to Template::content() due to the addition of generators in PHP 5.5.


### 0.6.1

#### Regression fixes

- Permissions Matrix silently didn't work - issue #596
- Redirect after login - was redirecting to '/', regardless of the previous page or per-role redirect settings
- Site settings failed to save sometimes, under PHP 5.4 - issue #618

#### Upgrade Notes:

Version 0.6 prevented CSRF attacks using a standard CodeIgniter option.  This should protect against clicking a malicious link (e.g. in an email or forum post), which attempts to perform actions on Bonfire.  E.g. deleting modules or changing user access rights.

When upgrading to Bonfire 0.6.1, you should make sure to update config.php in the application/config folder.  This is necessary in order to enable and configure CSRF protection.

As a result, any AJAX POST request you have will need to include the CSRF token.  If you don't already know how to do this, Bonfire 0.6.1 includes a simple solution.  You just need two extra lines.

In the controller for the page which launches the AJAX request:

    Assets::add_js('codeigniter-csrf.js')

In the AJAX request, an extra data field:

    // assuming your data is not passed as a string
    $.ajax({ ..., type: "POST", data:
                   { ... 'ci_csrf_token' : ci_csrf_token() } } );
    // or
    $.post(url,
                   { ... 'ci_csrf_token' : ci_csrf_token() }, ... );
    // or
    $(elt).load(url,
                   { ... 'ci_csrf_token' : ci_csrf_token() } );
