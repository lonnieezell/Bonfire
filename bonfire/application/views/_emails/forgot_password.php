<p>So, you forgot your <?php echo config_item('site.title') ?> password, eh? No worries!</p>

<p>Just below you will find temporary password that you can use to login to <?php echo config_item('site.title') ?>. Then, you can change your password to something different (because we are sure your temp password isn't going to be easy to remember...)</p>

<p>And make sure you do... this password is only good for this one time!</p>

<p>Your temporary password is <b><?php echo $new_pass ?></b></p>
