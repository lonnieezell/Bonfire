	<li><a href="http://codeigniter" target="_blank">CodeIgniter</a> and the Reactor Team that have worked so hard to build a fantastic framework.</li>
	<li><a href="http://jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a>, who has made working with javascript fun again.</li>

	<li><a href="http://philsturgeon.co.uk/" target="_blank">Phil Sturgeon</a> for his great work in the CodeIgniter community, in general, and the inspiration and learning by looking through his <a href="http://pyrocms.com" target="_blank">PyroCMS</a> code.</li>
